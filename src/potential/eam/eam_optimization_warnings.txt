Warning: things removed or not generic after EAM optimizations

- scale not passed in
# - pair_enabled test removed
- fast path for EAM Alloy not generalized to other EAM potentials
- fast compute strategy not propagated to single mat EAM
- lack Virial computation option (for flat_arrays only)
- simulation_thermodynamic state only gather field::ep not field::flat_ep so trajectory is good but using flat_arrays the potential energy and virial are always zero
