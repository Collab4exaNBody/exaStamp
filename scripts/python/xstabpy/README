# xstabpy

xstabpy stands for eXaSTAamp TABulation with PYthon; it is a basic,
simple script to write tabulated potential data in yaml format ready
to be used by exastamp.


## Usage

You can tabulate a predefined potential (currently only Lennard-Jones,
Sutton-Chen and VNIITF are implemented) using your own parameters (see
example.py), or create a new pair or EAM potential.

If you want to create a new potential, a pair potential is an object
with a __call__ method which takes a distance input (scalar or 1D
array) and returns a tuple containing the associated energy and
derivate. To create a new EAM potential, you need three methods, rho,
phi and f based on the same principle.

A set of abstract classes could have been implemented but it did not
happened by lack of time. Feel free to improve this small piece of
code ...
