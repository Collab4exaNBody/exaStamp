Operator overload resolution :
  - determined at graph setup, not at run time
  - uses the pseudo sequential model :
    types are infered as if pure sequential execution (w.r.t. slot connection model)
    all batch operators are considered non conditional and single step (no loop)

Slot connection :
  - rules, redefine it clearly
  - pre-connected, run time connected


Operator instanciation and dynamic connection:
  - first choose a branching model

important topics :
  - dump/restartable jobs, iterative batches depending on environment (ccc_user) w.r.t to ahead task spawn
  - batch types ( loop-conditional, single-conditional, unconditional ), inner pipes connections rules
