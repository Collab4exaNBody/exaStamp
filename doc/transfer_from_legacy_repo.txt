1. On the legacy history trunk, the last checkpoint is the following commit
commit 1297870491bb59aab9d68bbdaa0b11c8a2ffa458 (HEAD -> xsp-release-3.3.2, tag: before-github-2024, usb/xsp-release-3.3.2, origin/xsp-release-3.3.2, inti/xsp-release-3.3.2)

    improved compatibility with future version of exaNBody


2. a new branch, has been created, starting from the very first history commit, and adding the files by checkouting them from before-github-2024
> git checkout -b main 9258f3def6dcf1d6ee20e6e5f93e20bb022a9916
> git checkout before-github-2024 -- addons cmake contribs data doc include scripts src
> git commit -am "jump start from state @ before-github-2024"

3. so the new branch main, contains the recent state of files but without history
> git log

    Dir organization

4. how to transfer a development made on legacy trunk to new branch 'main' ?
the strategy is 2-fold
  - first, rebase your development from before-github-2024 tag, so that you have this tag back in the history of your dev branch
  - second, use cherry-pick to re-apply commits of your dev branch to the new 'main' branch

5. exemple
a) i created a dev branch on the legacy trunk
> git checkout -b xsp-my_test_dev2
> ** create some commits ***

b) rebase my branch from before-github-2024 point
> git rebase before-github-2024
Rebasage et mise à jour de refs/heads/xsp-my_test_dev2 avec succès.

c) jump to the new main branch, and re-apply the commits from your branch
> git checkout main
> git 

git cherry-pick <start-commit-hash>^..<end-commit-hash>
